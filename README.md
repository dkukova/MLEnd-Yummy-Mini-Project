# ECS7020P Mini-Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning pipeline for two components: Basic and Advanced.

### Basic Component
The basic component involves building a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a dish in a given photo has rice or chips, using the MLEnd Yummy Dataset.

### Advanced Component
For the advanced component, the problem formulated is to predict the likeness rating given by the student based on the picture of the food and additional annotations in the MLEnd Yummy Dataset.

## File Structure

- `ECS7020P_miniproject_basic.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the basic component.
- `ECS7020P_miniproject_advanced.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for the advanced component.
